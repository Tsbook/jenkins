# The following users have a legacy API token. \ 
# Because legacy tokens are stored in a recoverable format, we recommend migrating to the new API token system. \ 
# Additionally, in previous versions of Jenkins, API tokens were automatically created for every new user. \ 
# Often, users did not use the token, resulting in a larger attack surface than necessary. \ 
# Automatic token generation must now be enabled explicitly.
