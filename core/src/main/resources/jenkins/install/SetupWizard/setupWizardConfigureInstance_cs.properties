# Jenkins URL
Jenkins\ URL=
# The Jenkins URL is used to provide the root URL for absolute links to various Jenkins resources. \ 
# That means this value is required for proper operation of many Jenkins features including email notifications, PR status updates, and the <code>BUILD_URL</code> environment variable provided to build steps.<br />\ 
# The proposed default value shown is <strong>not saved yet</strong> and is generated from the current request, if possible. \ 
# The best practice is to set this value to the URL that users are expected to use.  This will avoid confusion when sharing or viewing links.
